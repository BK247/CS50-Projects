sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: Faster than sort 3 with an ordered list.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: On sorting through the random 50,000, it takes significantly less time.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort only has to swap if they're not in order. In an ordered list, bubble will be fast than selection, as selection still has to pass over each time.
